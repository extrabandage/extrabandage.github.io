<p class="title">untitled<br><br>

i was sick.<br><br>

my eyes would skim over a patch of green and wander on. is that a puppy over there? how cute.<br><br>

sick.<br><br>

i did not see the sapling struggling to grow in the dog's piss.</p><br><br><br>


<p class="title">intaglio<br><br>

like the skin of a pineapple,<bR>
i guard and keep you at bay,<bR>
but the knife that slices in,<bR>
reveals beneath,<bR>
flesh<bR>
that is sour,<bR>
that is sweet,<bR><bR>

and i for one cannot tell <bR>
whether this brings me joy or pain,<bR><bR>

joy from the loss of a burden,<bR><bR>

or pain from an open wound.

you moan His name against my mouth,<br>
and burn my tongue with praise,<br>
of faith and religion, i have none,<br>
but oh, with you, i seek heaven,<br>
so I take your body in communion, <br>
set up a confessional in the dark,<br><br>

Behold the lamb of god!<br>
Who died and rose again!<br><br>

you offer me your lips in benediction,<br>
i bite the flesh until it bleeds,<br>
the tears that run down the pink<br>
of your cheeks absolve me.<br>
<p class="title">in nomine patris</p><br><br><br>

palms damp with sweat<br>
i hold yours (hand), dry, in mine<br>
grip, the skin is warm <br>
you laugh and my heart<br>
laughs with you<br>
<p class="title">untitled</p><br><br><br>

i shake<br>
a love i do not know<br>
like snow gathering<br>
piles up<br>
only to melt<br>
at the kiss of the sun<br>
<p class="title">untitled</p><br><br><br>

  mother, mother, please stop fumbling over your words, i am tired of sanding down the sharp edges of your accent.⁣<br><br>
  ⁣ingrate, ingrate, your tongue melts like butter in your mouth, may the words of my own country choke you.⁣

bittermelon rots on the side of the street -
the air is heavy and sour, flea-ridden mutts
wave their tails in surrender to the sun.
picking at paper, at plastic, a boy, eyes defiant,
watches ladies smelling of papaya clutch at their purses,
watching their flat noses turn up.
he frowns, this heap bears no spoils of war,
but not everyone will go hungry,
a swallowtail butterfly stops
to take a drink by his feet.

betrayal, my mother says.<br>
when i tell her i’m not going<br>
to your wedding, as if i’ve<br>
just kissed you upon your cheek<br>
and called you rabbi.<br>
<p class="title">untitled</p><br><br><br>


on sundays, i would wear white dresses and recite prayers to save my soul. i would kneel, sit, and stand-up as i was told. my mother would sometimes hand me a dollar to give to the priest and i would do so with utmost purpose. i didn’t care about repairing the roof of the church, i wanted to bribe my way into heaven.
<br><p class="title">all homos go to heaven</p><br><br><br>

dark corridors<br>
Flesh meets bone<br>
guilt seeps <br>
through Marrow<br>

toxic when eaten,<br>
cant even feed it <br>
to the Dogs<br>
choke,<br>
<p class="title">parasite</p><br><br><br>
  
spilling out, like guts from the cut<br>
of a cow's bulging stomach<br>
weeping, Yes, these are your fears<br>
i had not buried them deep enough<br>
the churn of my stomach<br>
spinning dizzily<br>
like a blank disc on the burner<br>
i will tell you what your pain is,<br><br>
i will brand it on the surface of your skin<br>
<p class="title">untitled</p><br><br><br>
  
i bury you before me<br><br>
taste the dirt piled on top<br>
tears shed like fur<br>
on a pups spring coat<br>
these seasons change<br>
like nothing.<br>

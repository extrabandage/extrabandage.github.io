  mother, mother, please stop fumbling over your words, i am tired of sanding down the sharp edges of your accent.⁣<br><br>
  ⁣ingrate, ingrate, your tongue melts like butter in your mouth, may the words of my own country choke you.⁣

<br><br>

bittermelon rots on the side of the street -
the air is heavy and sour, flea-ridden mutts
wave their tails in surrender to the sun.
picking at paper, at plastic, a boy, eyes defiant,
watches ladies smelling of papaya clutch at their purses,
watching their flat noses turn up.
he frowns, this heap bears no spoils of war,
but not everyone will go hungry,
a swallowtail butterfly stops
to take a drink by his feet.

<p>Itâ€™s a few hours past midnight. The rest of the city sleeps, but down by the polluted river beds, the market begins to wake up.</p>

<p>The market is mostly smell and sound. There is a ripe scent of spilled liquor and day-old fruits, and the fishmongersâ€”their cries of having the freshest catch and the lowest pricesâ€” hang stubbornly in the humid air, sticky, even with the nightâ€™s cooling breeze.</p>

<p>The bodies of the crowd melt into one, but within the mass, a small girl weaves her way through. She follows the sound of the fishmongerâ€™s voices as they lead her further into the market. Here, silence is downfall, and one manâ€™s livelihood is another manâ€™s death. The further she walks into the belly of the market, the more it suffocates her with its smell and sounds. She must keep walking or she too will fall.</p>

<p>Eventually, she finds herself trapped behind a drunken pair of men as they sway in rhythmic stupor. She has no choice but to slow down her pace, careful not to run right into them. They slur out fragments of what seems to be a poem, or maybe a song, in a dead language. They giggle underneath their breaths and bask in the warmth of a world only the two of them know. Thereâ€™s an itch of curiosity rising in her throat. How desperately she wants to know the words that leave their lips, the tune that escapes their lungs. But no. No stopping. She canâ€™t be late.</p>

<p>A few more feet forward and she drifts to the right entering a side street. The street has nothing to identify itself by, and the sources of light are few and far between. The air here is easier to take in, the sounds of the market fade into whispers. Itâ€™s peaceful, but itâ€™s lonely, and even with the sweat beading along her forehead, she feels cold.</p>

<p>The small girl passes one, two, three stalls; this stall sells precious stones from the neighboring town, this stall sells ancient bamboo flutes, and the last stallâ€”no one mans the front, but the smell of dried blood coming from it is heavy and pungent.</p>

<p>The last stall belongs to the butcher. Heâ€™s known in the market for accepting almost any type of game as long as the pay is right. His customers are few at this time of nightâ€”like tonight, when his business is slow, he talks idly with the man who sells cigarettes across the street, smoke trailing out between their lips with every other word. Puffs of dirtied smoke snake around one another in a lazy, lecherous dance.</p>

<p>The girl moves closer to the abandoned stall. In the center of the wooden counter, a cleaver rests wedged into the surface. The knifeâ€™s blade is wider than her palm, and she can see her small, round face staring back at her through bloodied steel. She makes a silly face at her reflection and then another. The universe remembers sheâ€™s just a child, but the sentiment is worth nothing. In a world like this, a child is not a child is not a child.</p>

<p>With an awkward jolt, but unexpected ease, she pulls the butcherâ€™s cleaver free from the surface of the stained counter. The knife dangles uncomfortably from her small hand. Itâ€™s heavier than the other knives sheâ€™s held before, but that doesnâ€™t matter. She canâ€™t mess up tonight. Sheâ€™s hungry. So, so hungry. She grips her fingers along the handle the best she can. Her palms turn white and her veins become angry. Without waiting for the weight to settle in further, without taking another breath, she swings her arm with a violent momentum, the knife lurching out of her hands with a scary semblance of grace. She smiles upon its release. A good job; tonight, she will go home having done a good job. A second passes, then another. The girl glances down at the tiny streaks of red smeared against her pale palm, the pink of her own skin returning. She thinks about the weight of the blade in her hand and the emptiness she feels now. Her smile disappears. At the same time, the butcherâ€™s cleaver has found a new home through the cigarette sellerâ€™s skull.</p>

<p>Discord erupts across the street. There are people screaming and people crying out for an ambulance. Unflinching, the girl walks back towards the main street of the market, against the current of the building crowd, weaving between towers of people who donâ€™t notice her. The small girl doesnâ€™t know who they are calling for. The police wonâ€™t come this close to the river nor will the ambulances. If even god has forsaken the people of the river bed, what expectation is there of other men?</p>

<p>The small girlâ€™s stomach lets out a grumble as she finally frees herself from the heat of the crowd. Itâ€™s a small cry that crunches the inside of her thin torso. She places her hand above her belly to soothe the ache. She will be okay. Tonight should earn her at least a boiled egg. Maybe a piece of pan de sal, if Tatay is feeling nice. The thought brings a skip to her step. For once, she canâ€™t wait to get home. The sticky air of the market follows her all the way, but she doesnâ€™t care. With the streets now empty and quiet, she tries to hum the song she heard from the two drunk men.</p>

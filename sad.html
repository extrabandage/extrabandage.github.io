<p>“Marie.”</p>

<p>A voice called out to her in the blinding light. She couldn't make out who, or what, the voice belonged to, but it was a gentle sound. So gentle it unnerved her.</p>

<p>“Marie,” it called out again.</p>

<p>Where was she? And how did she get here? Only moments ago, she was shrouded in an unnatural darkness. She was in so much pain. But then it all went away, replaced by the light and a feeling of weightlessness. </p>

<p>Could this be the so-called light at the end of the tunnel? What could have led to this? But no matter how much Marie tried to remember, she could not recall what made her feel so much pain, what thrusted her into that pitch-black darkness.</p>

<p>It was her desire to find answers to her questions that got her moving. Or at least she felt as though she were moving. Left foot. Right foot. One in front of the other. She went through the motions, but nothing around her changed. The only difference was in the distance of the voice as it periodically called out her name—it grew closer and closer.</p>

<p>She did not know how long she walked for, only that she started then stopped. And it was an abrupt stop, for mid-step Marie suddenly felt an embrace of warmth. It felt as if it were a sunny afternoon at the park, the sunlight kissing her exposed skin. It was that which caused her to stop as well as the sudden whisper of her name right into her ear.</p>

<p>“Marie…”</p>

<p>Her own name was beginning to sound foreign to her. A shiver ran down her spine. Unable to take it anymore, she replied.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where am I?”</p>

<p>Her voice came out quiet. Almost inaudible. But whatever was there with her heard her perfectly.</p>

<p>“I am yours. You are with me.”</p>

<p>Marie tried to make sense of what was said to her, but with little luck. She shook her head as if trying to physically rid herself of the confusion welling up inside.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t answer anything. I don’t understand,” she said, “I was just walking ho-”</p>

<p>“Yes. And then I took you away.”</p>

<p>“Took me away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I took you away from that world. Saved you from its suffering. You, who has a soul like no other. For as I am yours, so are you mine.”</p>

<p>The words sounded empty to Marie. Empty and self-serving. There was no way this was real.</p>

<p>“Suffering?” Marie repeated in disbelief. “I wasn't suffering! Where is my family? My little brother is waiting for me at home! I need to–”</p>

<p>Her voice became more frantic as she spoke. But nothing she said mattered. She was cut off by the same, even voice she had been hearing since the beginning. </p>

<p>“Rejoice. For you are with me.”</p>

<p>Marie couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She hoped this was all just one bad dream, but she knew better. That pain? That darkness? She knew all too well that this wasn’t a dream. And it made her all the more terrified to know.</p>

<p>Around her, the warmth became a blistering heat, flames licking her too exposed skin. She wanted to get away, go anywhere but here. But what else could do other than be swallowed up by the light?</p>

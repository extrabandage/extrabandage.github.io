<p>Kayla Mathers came to school today with a clunky cast on her arm.<br><br>

The classroom got really noisy as soon as she walked in. She’d been gone for a week. I don’t really like her so I didn’t keep track or anything.<br><br>

Everyone gathered around her and I could tell she was absolutely soaking in the attention, talking about how she got injured (she fell down the stairs, by the way) and about how hot the doctor who took care of her was.<br><br>

Stupid bitch. Shut up. Just shut up.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Mom keeps complaining that I’m not doing enough. What is enough? I don’t really get it.<br><br>

But whenever Jacob comes home she finally leaves me alone. All of a sudden the perfect son has come home and he requires much more attention than I do.<br><br>

I bet it’s because I remind her of Dad. I remind her of Dad so she hates me. It’s kinda funny... I should be sad that she hates me, but I don’t know if I am or not.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Gym class is the only reason why I bother with school, but no one likes it. I don’t know why.<br><br>

My favorite thing to do is run. It feels good when I’m out of breath and my chest gets all bothered and my arms and legs ache.<br><br>

What’s that word when you like things that hurt? I don’t know how you can be like that and I don’t really get it, but I like being tired. I like being too tired to think. Too hurt to do anything. Maybe I am whatever that word is.</p><br><br><br>

Today at lunch I sat down at the same place I usually do. I sit with the same people all the time, but we’re not really friends or anything. Some people might think we are, but they ain’t know shit so what do I care.<br><br>

But that’s not the point. <br><br>

For the first time ever, Kayla and this dumb jock sat down together in front of me. Normally, she sat with these three other girls somewhere else. It caught me off guard and made it hard for me to pay attention to my plate of spaghetti, but I tried anyway. I ended up getting sauce all over my shirt, but I got to hear something interesting. <br><br>

Apparently when you fracture a bone, it ends up growing stronger. I wonder if it’s true.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Jacob came home really late today. Mom cried about it. What a drama queen. He was probably just out fucking some girl with big tits and a college degree. He likes them older like that.<br><br>

Mom thinks he’s so pure. Her saint, her angel, her knight in shining armor to prove that she’s not a complete waste after Dad left.<br><br>

Too bad Mom. Your boy is tainted and dirty like everyone else.<br><br>

We both are.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I’m still thinking about what I overheard the other day. Do bones really get stronger after they break? I did some research and most websites said they don’t, but I don’t believe it. I mean, muscles get stronger through wear-and-tear, right? So bones gotta be the same way. They gotta be.</p>

<p>Kayla and that guy are dating apparently. I heard it when I was heading to the bathroom.<br><br>

I didn’t recognize the girls talking about them.<br><br>

I don’t even think they’re in our grade.<br><br>

School is a weird place. No one likes their own business, so they just pay attention to everyone else’s.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I had to run a mile today during gym. I was a lot faster than everyone else and man, it felt really good, but then the teacher just had to pull me aside and say that I should join the track team.<br><br>

Buzzkill!
<br><br>
As soon as he said that, I hated running. I told him “no thanks, sir” and said I had no time. A lie. I have all the time in the world really, but I just wanted him to leave me alone.<br><br>

When school finally ended like four hours later, I ran all the way home even though it’s far as hell. I got yelled at when I got home, but it was worth it. I love running, after all.</p><br><br><br>

<p>One of the guys who sits at my table during lunch said his dad owns a junkyard. Is that a good thing? Owning a junkyard? Is owning trash a good thing? I asked him all of this and I didn’t mean anything bad by it, but he got really mad. Like really mad. So mad he must be stupid. Like why’d you have to get that mad for? You should fix your temper. I only asked a question. I said all that to him too—so he ended up breaking my nose and I had to get sent to the hospital. <br><br>

Mom didn’t cry or nothing when she came to pick me up. She looked more disgusted than anything. Well, whatever. At least, I finally broke a bone! I wonder if it’ll get stronger.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I used the fight as an excuse to skip school this week. As long as I’m quiet Mom doesn’t care what I do and Jacob only checks on me when he’s here, which is almost never, so I can pretty much do whatever I wanna.<br><br>

I spent all day today looking up tons of pictures of people with broken bones and things like that. Now that I’ve finally broken something I feel like I’m a part of something bigger. Like I belong.<br><br>
And, y’know, the human body is really fascinating. There’s 206 bones in the whole thing. The finger alone has three bones so if someone goes “I’ve broken three bones before!” don’t be too impressed. They probably just broke their pinky.</p>

People on the internet are kind of gross. Apparently, some people like to post more than just broken bones.<br><br>

There are tons of videos of people crawling out of cars after an accident or videos of skateboarders with their shinbone jutting out after a wrong move. I even saw a video of a guy shooting his own brains out with a shotgun!<br><br>

I’m being forced to go back to school tomorrow and damn, I wish I had friends to talk to about those videos. They’re too gross to just keep to myself.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Kayla wasn’t at lunch today.<br><br>

She didn’t sit at my table with her guy and I couldn’t see her at her old table or anywhere else. I was really curious about where she was, but it’s not like I could just ask anyone. Who would I even have asked?
<br><br>
But later that day when I was sneaking off to the bathroom again, those same girls from last time were talking about her. They said something about her getting injured again. Soon as I heard this, I approached them.<br><br>

Man, the scent of their perfume when I walked up to them was so strong I wanted to throw up. I had to start breathing out my mouth. They looked at me funny, but maybe it’s because they figured out I thought they stunk.<br><br>

They talked at the same time and way too fast but basically that one guy I saw her with, her latest boyfriend, was a great guy, but he had a bad temper. He had a bad temper and a bad habit of tossing her around. This time he tossed her around a bit too hard and now she’s got a broken rib and a dislocated shoulder. But the girls told me not to worry though because he’s such a great guy he definitely didn’t mean it. <br><br>

Are they stupid? I wasn’t going to ask them this out loud, but I ended up asking anyway because seriously, are they stupid? As soon as the words came out my mouth I ran like hell back to class. My nose was still healing after all. I didn’t want it to break again before I found out if it’d gotten stronger or not.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I went to the hospital for my last appointment but there was a problem because my mom was supposed to be with me. I lied and said she was at work, but they said I couldn’t leave until she came. I knew she wasn’t going to answer my calls so Jacob had to come get me.<br><br>

He was real quiet on the drive home. Not like he talks to me all that much anymore anyway. I think he did want to say something when we got into our driveway but I was already out of his car by then. I had something important to do after all. <br><br>

I ran into the house, snuck some pliers into my room, and locked the door.<br><br>

I was real nervous at first because what if I was wrong? I gave the bridge of my nose a little pinch with my own fingers to test it out. Then I realized what a chickenshit I was being, took the pliers to my nose, and gripped that thing tight. So tight I heard a crack. I waited for the pain to come, but it never did.<br><br>

It worked. My nose got stronger!<br><br>

Some blood got on my shirt though, but I’m sure that was just a body thing to do.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Mom told me my nose was crooked during breakfast. She sounded annoyed and said that those damn doctors didn’t do their jobs properly to set it. Jacob looked confused. He told her that my nose was fine, but then he took a good look at me again and then looked even more confused. Then he had the nerve to ask me if I had done anything to my nose since yesterday because there was a new bruise or something on it. He tried to reach out to me but I hit his hand away and left to catch the bus.<br><br>

Of course I did something to it, stupid. I made it stronger!</p><br><br><br>

<p>That stupid teacher asked me to join the track team again.<br><br>

Why don’t people ever understand that no means no? But I guess no doesn’t really mean no; in this case, at least, because I did give in.<br><br>

Teacher’s a really troublesome guy and I didn’t like him approaching me twice about the same thing like that. If I were a bit tougher I could’ve said no and meant it, but I’m not.<br><br>

He really buttered me up by saying I could lead the track team to Nationals. Bullshit. Utter bullshit, but still, he made me feel real big and real good.<br><br>

Turns out he knew my dad too. They were classmates or something, said my dad was a great runner too, a good teammate to have. The teacher looked real proud to be talking about the past. I hope I don’t become like that. The past is the last place I want to be stuck in.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I did it! I broke another bone. I’m kind of annoyed it took me 5 months to break another one, but I can’t just be breaking bones on command. Well, I guess I could, but ain’t that suspicious? <br><br>

Anyways, this one teacher made me go and grab some boxes from the science lab to bring to her truck. They were so heavy. I wanted to ask what was in them because what the heck were they so heavy for, but I’d never really spoken to her before and I didn’t want to start now. The last box left was the heaviest. Just keeping it in my arms made me feel like I was going to die. And y’know what? I didn’t die, but I did drop the box and I did break my arm.<br><br>

The rest of the day went by in a blur. I only remember going in and out of the hospital (again) and having my mom scream at me (again).
<br><br>
My arm hurts something awful, but at least the brace on my arm is pretty. All nice and white. I can’t wait to test this bad boy out.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Since my arm broke, I ‘m not allowed to run. The teacher looked really bummed, but what can he do? My experiment’s more important to me anyway. After 8 weeks, my arm’ll be ready to test out as much as I want.</p><br><br><br>

Mom cried over Jacob again. This time he was gone the whole weekend. She drank a lot too because of him. When he came home on Sunday night, she was so plastered she threw an empty bottle at the door as soon as he came in. Her aim wasn’t good so it hit the doorframe, but a piece hit Jacob’s cheek and it was pretty bloody. He didn’t say anything, even when Mom clung to his legs apologizing and telling him not to leave like that again. He was just quiet the whole time. <br><br>

It was the first time I saw him make a face like that at Mom and it made me wonder how it felt for him to make that face knowing Mom wouldn’t remember it tomorrow.</p> <br><br><br>

<p>Mom doesn’t remember a thing. Jacob’s pretending not to either. They’re all smiles this morning. I think the milk’s gone bad.</p><br><br><br>

<p>My wrist is free!<br><br>

This whole breaking bones business is great and all, but it’s a really itchy thing to do. Kinda smelly too. I had to stay in the shower extra long to scrub at my arm until I finally felt clean enough. Either way, it might just be in my head, but I feel better than I ever did having been a broken-bone-virgin. I feel strong. Like I could scale a mountain or fight in a UFC match. <br><br>

My idea this time was to punch something and to punch that something hard. I’d never been much of a fighter before, well, honestly I’ve never thrown a punch at all. But I figured that punching the column holding up the patio would be a good way to prove that I’d gotten stronger. <br><br>

The first hit I got in, I was a little too nervous. I missed. When I threw a punch the second time, I made sure to put my heart into it and it was my nose all over again. I didn’t feel a damn thing! As long as I focused, I was able to hit the column over and over and over again with no problem. But then my knuckles started to tear and bleed and I didn’t really know of any excuse I could give to my mom or Jacob and I didn’t wanna deal with that. I really wanted keep going, but that was good enough for the night.</p> <br><br><br>

<p>Jacob got really worried over nothing this morning. He saw my knuckles and freaked out. Mom went to meet with some friends, thankfully, so I didn’t have to deal with her.<br><br>

What’s with him anyway? He does all sorts of shit and no one says anything, but I have some ripped skin on my knuckles and all of a sudden we need to call the police?
<br><br>
He’s so annoying. I told him that too. He looked sad when I said that—which I don’t get. He says that to Mom all the time.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I don’t know how long it’s been, like I said I don’t really care about her, since Kayla was last in school.<br><br>

Those girls from last time told me she just had a broken rib and a dislocated shoulder. What’s taking her so long to heal? I healed up right fast. Maybe only certain people get stronger when they break bones. Maybe I’m just special. That'd suck for Kayla.<br><br>

Or maybe she’s actually recovering faster than everyone thinks and she’s just keeping it a secret. It'd annoy me if that was true so I asked around about her. Besides, if she knew how to get stronger faster then maybe she'd be willing to teach me. Maybe I'd be wrong about her, maybe she wasn’t just a stupid bitch.</p><br><br><br>

<p>Jesus. That jock really went after me today. Called me a creep and a pervert, asked me why I was so concerned about “his girl”. His friends were all watching too. At least I’m pretty sure they were. After the fifth punch or so I couldn’t really see anybody or anything.<br><br>

But I think my experiments have been working because by the third hit I didn't feel anything. I just remember things going dark and hitting the ground and then when I came to, Jacob was driving me to the hospital.<br><br>

He looked really mad, so mad I thought we were gonna crash. But we didn’t, and I ended up falling asleep as soon as we got to the ER.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I guess I should be thankful to that dick. He broke my jaw and my nose (my nose must be invincible by now), and left me with a black eye and a constant ringing in my head. I don’t think those last two things will help me get stronger, but at least the shiner looks pretty cool.<br><br>

Overall, my face is pretty numb and I’m really tired. Doctor said I needed to stay at the hospital for a while but my mom kicked up a storm about it. She said she didn’t have the money to pay for what she could do for free at home. All the hospital people were pretty annoyed at her about it, but my mom can be a real pain in the ass, so they agreed as long as she got the medicine for me and promised to take me back after four days. The whole time though Mom didn’t cry over me or nothing. In fact, I’ve never seen her cry over me. I wonder how beaten up I'd need to get for that to happen.<br><br>

Maybe I should test that out too one day?</p><br><br><br>

<p>I’ve been at home for a week now (again). Mom never took me back to the hospital and the doctors are busy with other people so they probably just forgot about me. Jacob’s really annoying lately, always checking up on me and wanting to talk. But he’s not really talking with me, just at me.<br><br>

He’s told me a lot of stuff this past week than he has for the last 8 years. Like, apparently he’s never had a steady girlfriend because Mom’s scared the fuck out of him so he just has booty calls and one night stands, but he really wishes he could find someone to fix him up or something. Stupid guy. Fix yourself up. You're a man, ain't you? I’m doing just fine without sticking my dick anywhere, wanting anyone to fix me. He’s also doing really lousy at school because he gets really down sometimes and doesn’t wanna go to his classes or do his work. His friends are worried about him and whatever but he doesn’t want to annoy him with his problems. Why’s he annoying me with them then?</p><br><br><br>

<p>Kayla Mathers died today.
<br><br>
I’m all healed up then I go and I find out Kayla Mathers has gone and died. Mom broke the news during dinner. She said it real calm-like, threw in the word whore like she was spicing up some food.
<br><br>
Apparently, the police found her body near Old Man’s Park, on account of all the old men bumming there, and they’re trying to find out what happened. I don’t really know how to feel. Like I said, I don’t really care about her, but it’s true then, I guess. Not all of us who get broken get stronger. I’m just special.</p> 

<p>Jacob went out again tonight. Mom is in the living room drinking. Earlier she came by my door, and I guess she thought I was asleep because she just started laughing really loudly outta nowhere.<br><br>

She said something about how it was my fault that Dad left, that I look and act way too much like him. She even wished I was more like Jacob. 
<br><br>
If I were like Jacob she’d cry if I so much as got a scratch. But I’m not like Jacob at all, so she’d never cry for me.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I’m going back to school tomorrow. All this time stuck at home has given me the chance to realize that everyone around me is really weak.<br><br>

Kayla was so weak she stayed with a guy who beat her up and probably killed her (the police think it was one of them old men but I know better). Jacob is so weak he can’t tell the difference between a saint and trash. Mom is so weak Dad left her for a younger woman with bigger curves and a tighter pussy. But me? I’ve only broken four bones yet I’m stronger and better than ever. 
<br><br>
That's what's wrong with everyone. They could make themselves stronger if they just applied themselves. But I guess they just like being the way they are, maybe they don't know how to be anything else.<br><br>

Whatever.<br><br>

Tomorrow I’ll prove to them that even the weak can become strong. But it’s not enough for me to break one bone at a time, it’s too slow. <br><br>

The north building on campus is only seven stories high, but it should do the trick. I’ll show them all. The weak me you knew today will be gone tomorrow. He’ll be gone. You can all cry about that.<br><br><br>

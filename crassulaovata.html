<i><small>*reformatted from an ao3 fanfic</small></i><br><br><br><br>

thank you for the love that has never made me feel lonely.

 

<br><br><br>

 

leon doesn’t know when the dreams began. he isn’t the type of person to dream of such things to begin with. but there is no doubt–every night he dreams of the same man embracing him with a comfort he never knew possible.<br><br>

 

for leon, falling in love is an interesting concept, but it’s just that, a concept. those dreams remain where they are otherwise in the deepest corners of his mind, tucked away in the darkness until the weight of his lids bids him to sleep and the warmth of his blanket is replaced by that man’s arms.<br><br>

 

in those dreams, he knows what love is. he knows that man’s face and his name, the way his hair boyishly frames his face. he knows the deep tan of his skin and the unexpected way he laughs. but when he wakes up, he loses all of it. always. his eyes will open to a white ceiling, the gloomy peek of daylight passing through his window. his throat will be dry and there will be a heavy weight in his chest, persistent and unforgiving. <br><br><br>

 



 

the museum hired leon straight out of college. it’s been about six years since the offer arrived in his inbox and he doesn’t have plans to leave any time soon. leon loves the feeling of wandering the halls in silence when no one’s around, whether it be day or night. he loves the tedious yet dedicated process of curating pieces for an exhibit, theme chosen by yours truly. each piece has a story, and each piece must fit into a story larger than its own. most importantly, he loves the sound of life entering the building when the front doors open in the morning and the way it disappears into a whisper at closing time. 
<br><br><br>
 



 

it’s a dream, but leon says i love you. he means it too. it’s an existence barely lingering on the tips of his fingers, but even then he feels the warmth it leaves when he wakes. and when he wakes, he is a little bit saddened, a little bit burdened, by the empty space in his bed, by the forgotten name in his head.<br><br><br>

 



 

on the day of new year’s eve, the museum still opens. it closes two hours earlier and remains closed the next day. it’s one of leon’s favorite days of the year. not because of the arrival of a new year, but because of the type of crowd that such a day brings to the museum. 
<br><br>
 

there aren’t too many people, maybe only an eighth of the normal turnout, but this is how he likes it best. when it’s not so crowded like this and most people, for reasons unknown to him, come by themselves, leon has a chance to observe. <br><br>

 

he observes people the way people observe the marble statues and oil paintings on display. he observes in a way he knows he can look, but god forbid, if he touch the art that lays before him. these people have lives outside these walls, off of these ceramic tiles and out into the wide, wild world. they have faces and voices and names he does not know. but when leon observes, he can, to the best of his abilities, try to.
<br><br><br>
 


 

he’s not lonely. he really isn’t. leon will swear. but he knows something’s missing. he knows his heart yearns for something he doesn’t quite understand, it yearns for someone he doesn’t quite know.
<br><br><br>
 



 

the man presses his lips softly to one side of leon’s face. it’s soft. warm. the other side of leon’s face is cradled by the man’s hand. it’s a little rougher, but just as warm, if not warmer. leon looks into the man’s eyes and it hurts, like he wants to cry and tear himself apart from the inside, but instead he buries his face into the man’s hand in desperation and whispers against his palm.
<br><br><br>
 



 

2022 is ending and the museum closes in an hour. leon should be happy today like he normally is at the end of the year, but he doesn’t. instead, he feels anxious and out of place, as if a button on his shirt hasn’t been matched correctly and he doesn’t even know it. 
<br><br>
 

he walks the halls of the museum, listening to the heels of his shoes hit the ground. it calms him a little to hear the noise echo through each room. some rooms are empty, some rooms have a visitor or two, but leon doesn’t stop to observe anyone like he normally does. he doesn’t know why, but he just keeps going. 

 <br><br>

he passes the contemporary ceramics, an exhibit on digitized film strips, the fine arts hall, and finally, at the end of the building is a door to the greenhouse. the greenhouse was part of the original building a century ago. the museum never got rid of it and instead displays sculptures and statues amongst the greenery inside. it was a popular spot to visit year round due to the ventilation system maintaining a cool, spring-like environment even in the heat of summer or cold of winter. 

 <br><br>

but as popular as it is, leon is not a regular visitor of the greenhouse. while the greenhouse is part of the museum, there are no actual pieces inside that are authentic or curated. with his role in the museum confining him to the main building, leon never had a reason to go in.

 

<br><br><br>

 

the greenhouse is larger than he thought, but also more beautiful. when he enters, he’s struck with silence at the door. it takes leon a few moments to regain himself, but once he does he begins to wander around. so many of them are tall, taller than he is. the greenhouse is almost built like a garden maze. there are colorful flowers twinkling everywhere, like stars amongst the shrubs. 
<br><br>
 

a certain plant catches his eye. it’s quite plain, set on a small stool instead of being part of the scenery like the others. it’s not as grand as what he’s seen so far, but for some reason, leon likes the way it looks. he heads towards it when he runs into something firm, something not made of leaves or flowers, but of flesh and bone like him.
<br><br>
 

“i’m sorry, i didn’t see y–”

 <br><br>

“shit– oh god, i’m sorry, i’m so– are you okay?”
<br><br>
 

the apologies clash into one another comically. leon would laugh if it weren’t for the fact that the voice sounds familiar, so, so familiar. he sees an employee badge on the man’s hip and involuntarily mumbles the name.
<br><br>
 

“rhys?”
<br><br>
 

“yes?”
<br><br>
 

at that point, leon finally looks up. 
<br><br>
 

leon prays he’s not dreaming.<br><br>

i was sick.<br><br>

my eyes would skim over a patch of green and wander on. is that a puppy over there? how cute.<br><br>

sick.<br><br>

i did not see the sapling struggling to grow in the dog's piss.
<br><p class="title">untitled</p><br><br>


like the skin of a pineapple,<bR>
i guard and keep you at bay,<bR>
but the knife that slices in,<bR>
reveals beneath,<bR>
flesh<bR>
that is sour,<bR>
that is sweet,<bR><bR>

and i for one cannot tell <bR>
whether this brings me joy or pain,<bR><bR>

joy from the loss of a burden,<bR><bR>

or pain from an open wound.

<br><p class="title">intaglio</p><br><br>




  blind man’s buff,<br>
  i see nothing.<br>
  a haze sets<br>
  between the rims<br>
  of my glasses<br>
  and the sharp<br>
  edges of words<br>
  i don’t mean.<br>
  a dull scream<br>
  echoes between all<br>
  these bodies<br><br>

  and me.


<br><p class="title">blind man's buff</p><br><br>


  the flower is quiet<br>
  yet the wind calls,<br>
  cradling her petals softly<br>
  love me, why won’t you love me<br>
  the wind cries to the flower<br>
  yet the flower is silent<br>
  i love you, i love you<br>
  the wind is persistent,<br>
  embracing the flower in its arms,<br>
  desperation, the wind is desperate<br>
  but the flower does not reply<br>
  mine, mine, mine<br>
  the wind swallows her petals<br>
  crushes her stem<br>
  upheaves her roots<br>
  steals her away <br>
  and the cries of the wind<br>
  leave echoes behind,<br>
  echoes of a flower <br>
  that is quiet.<br>

<p>I don't notice her until an impulse, one people get quite often around strangers, prompts me to turn my head in her direction. I've never seen her here before. I would know. The image of her stiff posture and her flat expression makes her hard to forget. With a squint of my eyes, I question her silently, warily. There are twenty other free seats in the waiting room, but she chooses the chair right next to me? Weird. I fidget where I sit and try to seek a comfort I know I won't find. </p>
  
<p>Uneasily, I look forward again. <i>Mind your own business.</i> And I redirect my thoughts elsewhere. What was I on about before? I try to think of something, anything, but my mind goes blank. All I know for sure is: in this space with just the two of us the air is a little bit too thin. It doesn't help that the room smells nauseatingly medicinal. There's also a hint of something else. Burnt eggs? No... not burnt... Whatever. Forget it. I'm just, I'm just being... The clock above the office door ticks and tocks like it's taunting me. The urge to tear it off the wall trembles in my hands. <i>Bury it.</i></p>

<p>The first time I came here, I felt like this. Or something similar to this. But it's been an odd year or two. Things have changed, should have. But this feeling... it's irritatingly familiar. My heart is ripping through me and I can feel the sweat build between my fingers and on the rough surface of my palms. My throat feels dry too. I think about the empty flourescent orange bottle left behind on my kitchen counter.</p>
  
  <p>I take a deep breath. <i>I have a a shovel at the ready.</i> Four, five, six breaths later, I glance back at the woman as subtly as I can. I make my eyes do most of the work. I do my best to barely move my neck. I glance over only to notice that she's beaten me to it.</p>

<p>I don’t know what unsettles me more. The fact that she's watching me or or the way she looks as she's doing so. There's nothing special about her, not in appearance. She's as plain as plain can be. But her eyes... her pupils seem to swallow all the light in the room. They're dark and dull, sitting in the corner, limited to a small crescent—an stranded ship drowning in a sea of white.  My eyes stay on her, not on her eyes, no, but on her nose or maybe on the center of her forehead. She won't let me look her in the eye. I don't know how I know that, but I know it. I'm not allowed to l; doing so would shatter the glass threads piecing me together.</p>
  
  <p>A few beats pass and, with surprising difficulty, I squeeze my eyes shut. What seems like an eternity is, like in many cliches, a mere second or so. Slowly, I peer past my hesitant lids only to find her still staring at me with a calmness that lodges itself in my throat. Nothing has changed. Not really: back straight, neck stiff, the grip of her fingers taut against her knees. But there's something different. Nothing I can see. Something I can feel.</p>
  
 
<p>There are stories of people who experience the neither-here-nor-there when they sleep. The whisper of a dream, light as a breeze, suddenly becomes heavier than the burden of  life. Are they still dreaming? Are they awake? This pressure they feel on their chest: trapped and helpless. <i>You're at my mercy now.</i> It's a limbo between fears and flesh. You are only freed when they allow you to be. Just like that. And here I was in the clinic's waiting room taken prisoner in this woman's neither-here-nor-there, at her mercy.</p>

<p>I'm not dreaming. I can't be. Today is January 13th and I woke up at 7A.M. like I normally do. I skipped breakfast, as I normally do, and skipped the shower, as I normally do. I changed my clothes. I try to think further past the veil of this morning's almost memories, but remember nothing else. All the appears is a field of static. Nothing. There's nothing. Why can't I think of anything?</p>

<p> For the first time, the woman next to me closes her eyes. But she doesn't blink. I don't know how to explain it. At least, not in words that can be accessed by human understanding, by human language. It doesn't matter. I use this as my chance and try to take control of myself again. But I can't. I can't move. I can barely think. I don't even know if I'm breathing anymore. My mind is shutting itself down, and—What is this feeling? I've never felt it before. What is this lightness in my chest? </p>

  <p><i>One pile of dirt, two, and three<br>
    Bury her underneath, keep her quiet,<br>
Keep her neat / Quiet, my child, you're dirty now. /<br>
    Let the earth settle, let her feast, <br>
    soon she will be clean.
    </i></p>

<p>The sound of footsteps destroys everything.</p>

<p>From behind the office doors, God creates Man. Someone heats up a meal in an aged microwave, the warning sizzles going unnoticed. A little further away, a medicinal cart rolls back and forth, forth and back. In another room, the printer clocks in and with determination, spits out contracts, lab results, and receipts.</p>

<p>My mother told me people are just mirrors. Just as the warmth of bodies behind those closed doors begin to rekindle, the warmth in my own does as well. My eyelids close and open. I relearn how to breathe. Close my eyes. Open my eyes. </p>

<p>And then the clinic's gone. There's only the woman and I. Her face is so close to mine her coarse hair curtains us in. I can tell she's smiling. It shows in the way her cheeks tighten and push upwards. But her smiles doesn't reach her eyes, those unpleasant and menacing eyes, eyes that really don't reflect a thing. I know, with those eyes, she sees everything. All of my secrets, all of my fears, all of my regrets. My past, present, future: lack of or otherwise. She sees all of it just like this.</p>

<p>I want to say something. It's like an itch crawling through my skin. The heart-pounding fear from earlier was better than this. At least then I felt remotely human. I open my mouth—</p>

<p>But the voice the comes out isn't mine. It's Marcella’s. </p>

  <p>  <i>Soon she will be clean.</i></p>
  
<p>Leaving the neither-here-nor-there, I face forward and look up. Marcella's smiling down at me with a plump hand on my shoulder. She's a bubbly lady, but a little too friendly for my taste. Still, I envy the Life that trickles out of her.</p>
  
<p>  You didn't sign in, Love<br>
  She says.</p>
  
<p>  I say nothing.</p>
  
  <p>She accepts my silence as an answer.</p>

<p>The doctor's ready to see me. </p>

<p>My body moves. I glance back to my seat before passing the threshold. The waiting room I had declared to be empty was anything but. In fact, only five seats or so were free. It isn't loud by any means, but it's far from the silence I had experienced. The fear must show on my face because Marcella nudges me as we pass through the halls. She smiles again, but it doesn't meet her eyes. I can't tell if it's genuine. </p>


<p>Maybe nothing is anymore.</p>

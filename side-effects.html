<p>I don't notice her until an impulse, one people get quite often around strangers, prompts me to turn my head in her direction. She sits to the left of me with no presence. I've never seen her here before. The image of her stiff posture and her flat expression will make her hard to forget. I question her silently. There are twenty other free seats yet she choses the chair right next to me? Odd. I fidget in my own chair, trying to seek a comfort I know I will never find. Come to think of it, when did she even come into clinic? I'm fairly sure no one had come in in the past 30 minutes. It had been completely silent. It still is. </p>
  
<p>Uneasily, I look forward again. <i>Mind your own business.</i> I redirect my thoughts elsewhere. What was I thinking about before? I try to think up the answer, but my mind goes blank. All I know for sure is that my nerves are going full-throttle and that in this space with just the two of us, the air is just a little bit too thin.</p>

<p>The room has a sterile smell—a smell only a hospital or clinic can have. There's also a hint of something else. Burnt eggs? No, that doesn't make sense. I'm just being weird right now. Even the clock above the office door ticks and tocks like it's taunting me. <i>Stop that.</i></p>

<p>Coming here doesn't make me nervous anymore, but this feeling... it's irritatingly familiar. My heart is racing and I can feel the sweat build between my fingers and the rough surface of my palms. My throat feels dry too. I think about the flourescent orange bottle left behind on my kithen counter. I take a deep breath. <i>Calm down.</i> Four, five, six breaths later, I direct my attention to the woman once more as subtly as I can. I make my eyes do most of the work. I barely move my neck. I glance over only to notice that she's beaten me to it.</p>

<p>I don’t know what unsettles me more. The fact that she's watching or or the way she looks as she's watching me. There's nothing special about her. She's as plain as plain can be. But her pupils seem to swallow all the light in the room despite being limited to a small crescent in the corner—an island drowning in a sea of white.  My eyes stay on her, not on her eyes, no, but her nose or maybe the center of her forehead. It feels as if I'm not allowed to look her in the eye. As if doing so would change the very foundation that keeps me standing.</p>
  
  <p>A few beats pass and, with surprising difficulty, I squeeze my eyes shut. What seems like an eternity is, like in many cliches, a mere second or so. Slowly, I peer past my hesitant lids only to find her still staring at me with a calmness that lodges itself in my throat. Nothing has changed. Not really: back straight, neck stiff, the grip of her fingers taught against her knees. But there's something different. Nothing I can see. Something I can feel.</p>
  
 
<p>There are stories of people who experience the neither-here-nor-there when they sleep. The whisper of a dream, light as a breeze, suddenly becomes heavier than the burden of a life. Are they still dreaming? Are they awake? This pressure they feel on their chest: trapped and helpless. <i>You're at my mercy now.</i> It's a limbo between fears and flesh. You are only freed when they allow you to be. Just like that. And here I was in the clinic's waiting room taken prisoner in this woman's neither-here-nor-there, at her mercy.</p>

<p>I'm not dreaming. I can't be. oday is January 13th. I made an appointment yesterday. I try to think past the veil of yesterday's almost memories and remember nothing. Even this morning appears to me through a field of static. Nothing. There's nothing. Why can't I think of anything? I woke up, I got ready, I came here, I signed in—No. I didn’t. I didn’t sign in. I didn’t walk up to the shut reception window as I normally do, as I've done many times before. I didn't greet Marcella, voice meek and unwilling. I didn’t do any of the things I'm so used to doing. Instead, I sat down in this chair. This chair sits to the back of the waiting room, right in the corner where a coffee table and lamp is. The word clausterphobia wouldn't do this feeling justice. Yet this is where I sat, opposite of my regular seat right in front of the office door.</p>

<p> For the first time during all of this, she shuts her eyes. But it's not a blink. I don't know how to explain it. Not in words that can be accessed by human understanding, by human language. I use this as my chance and try to move. But nothing does. I don't even know if I'm breathing anymore. My mind is shutting itself down, and—What is this feeling? I've never felt it before. What is this lightness in my chest? </p>

  <p><i>what you don't want,
    i want,
    but when you want it,
    i don't. even if it's so desired,
    even at the end of your rope.
    </i></p>

<p>The sound of footsteps destroys everything.</p>

<p>From behind the office doors, God began to create Man. Someone heats up a meal in an aged microwave, the warning sizzles going unnoticed. A little further away, a medicinal cart rolls back and forth, back and forth. In another room, the printer clocks in and with determination, spits out contracts, lab results, and receipts.</p>

<p>My mother told me people are just mirrors. Just as the warmth of bodies behind those closed doors begin to rekindle, the warmth in my own does as well. My eyelids go slack, close, and open. I relearn how to breathe. </p>

<p>And then the clinic's gone. There's only the woman and I. Her face is so close to mine her coarse hair brushes against my cheeks and curtains us in. I can tell she's smiling. It shows in the way her cheeks tighten and push upwards. But it doesn't reach her eyes, those unpleasant and menacing eyes. They really don't reflect a thing. I know, with those eyes, she sees everything. All of my secrets, all of my fears, all of my regrets. She sees all of it just like this.</p>

<p>I want to say something. I want to feel something, even the heart-pounding fear from earlier was better than this. But it's the same nothingness as usual. I open my mouth—</p>

<p>But the voice the comes out isn't mine. It's Marcella’s. </p>

  <p>  <i>Close your eyes. Open your eyes.</i></p>
  
<p>Leaving the neither-here-nor-there, I face forward and look up. Marcella's smiling down at me with a plump hand on my shoulder. She's a bubbly lady, but a little too friendly for my taste. Still, I envy the Life that trickles out of her.</p>
  
<p>  You didn't sign in, Love<br>
  She says.</p>
  
<p>  I say nothing.</p>
  
  <p>She accepts my silence as an aswer.</p>

<p>The doctor's ready to see me. </p>

<p>My body moves. It moves automatically, but still under my control. With a lingering sense of curiousity, I glance back to where I had been sitting. The waiting room I had declared to be empty was anything but. In fact, only five seats or so were free. It isn't loud by any means, but it's far from the silence I had experienced. The fear must show on my face because Marcella nudges me as we pass through the halls. She smiles again, but it doesn't meet her eyes. I can't tell if it is. </p>

<p>Maybe nothing is.</p>

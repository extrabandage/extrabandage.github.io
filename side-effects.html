<p>I didn’t notice her until, for some reason, I decided to turn my head in her direction. She was seated next to me, her posture tense and her expression solid. I questioned her silently. 20 other free seats, yet she chose the chair right next to me? Odd. I didn’t even hear her come in, that alone made me nervous enough to fidget in my seat. I was also fairly sure I was the only person in the room for the past 30 minutes. Where had she come from? Uneasily, I looked forward again, trying to mind my own business. What had I been doing to pass the time before I noticed her? I tried to think up the answer, but my mind went blank. All I knew for sure was that my nerves were beginning to go full-throttle and that in a space with just the two of us, I felt unbearably closed in.</p>

<p>The room had that sterile smell, that smell only a hospital or clinic has. There was also a hint of vanilla in the air. Probably the idea of one of the older nurses who knew that patients found the sterility off-putting. Nothing screams “run away!” like the scent of disinfectant and medical supplies wafting in the air while you wait to meet the doctor who’ll tell you what’s wrong (since they never really say what’s right) with you. The clock above the office door ticking and tocking on relentlessly like a taunting jeer was also unnerving at times. I can’t say hospitals and clinics make me nervous anymore though. Having gone to meet with this doctor and that (more times than I meet with my own mother) tends to desensitize one to the experience.</p>

<p>They don’t make me nervous, but now, in that tiny waiting room, I found my heart racing. I could feel my hands slowly build up a thin layer of perspiration, the sweat persistent on the soft pads of my fingers and the rounded hills of my palms. My throat felt dry too, but that was probably because I had just taken my pills for the morning and foolishly decided against drinking the recommended amount of water as dictated on the label of one of my many fluorescent orange bottles. I call it effort allocation. I gave up drinking that water in exchange for more time. I had to race to my car and, in turn, speed to the clinic because I had woken up when I should have already been out the door.</p>

<p>After a short period of quiet deliberation, although subtle this time, I directed my attention to the woman once more. Without shifting my head more than a few degrees, I let my eyes do the work. I glanced over only to notice that she had beat me to it. Without moving, without being conspicuous about it, she watched me. Had been, I assumed, as soon as I looked away the first time. I gulped down the fear in my throat. I really should’ve put more effort into filling my glass of water up that morning.</p>

<p><p>I don’t know what freaked me out more. The fact that she was watching me or just the general eeriness of her appearance. Her pupils, limited to a small crescent as she observed me through the sides of her eyes, were intensely dark. I had heard of people with purely black eyes, but the thought of it had never creeped me out until right at this moment. My eyes were fixated on her, but I couldn’t make eye contact, letting my focus fall onto her nose or the center of her forehead. It felt as if I wasn’t allowed to look her in the eye. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, mumbling softly to myself that I must be imagining things. Slowly, I peered past my hesitant lids, only to find her still staring at me with a calmness that lodged itself in my throat and mounted itself in place with sharp nails. She was still sitting the way she had when I first noticed her: back straight, neck elongated, hands pressed tight against her knees. Now her eyes strained to keep me within her sight, freezing me in place. Wasn’t it painful? Keeping her eyes focused on me like that? Weren’t her eyes hurting? I could feel a nagging sensation crawl through my body telling me to look away, not so much for her sake but for mine.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t. I was stuck. There are stories of people who get a certain way when they sleep. As if they’re in the middle of a pleasant, or not-so pleasant, dream and all of a sudden they can’t move. Stuck. They’re aware that they’re dreaming and they’re aware that they are somehow awake. It’s the limbo between dreams and reality. Something pins them down, a weight equally distributed throughout their body, eager to seize the unconquered land. The weight swallows them and the victim stays like that for hours until the nameless, unknown thing gets bored and decides to move on. Just like that. </p>

<p>I wasn’t dreaming, though. Of that much I was sure. I made an appointment the day before, prompted by the thin veil of haze that drifted against my thoughts whenever I tried to remember something, even if it had just occurred a moment ago. This morning, I took my medicine and, just now realizing, I also forgot to eat the meal to go with it. On the way, I tripped a little over the first step of the staircase trying to get into the clinic, which I brushed off quite well if I say so myself. Then, heading to the reception window, I signed my name and—No. I didn’t. I didn’t sign in. I didn’t walk up to the window as I normally would have, as I had done many times before. I didn’t greet Marcella who had been working at the clinic longer than I had been alive. I didn’t announce my arrival with a stupid look on my face as if to say “Haha, it’s me again.” I didn’t fumble around in my backpack for my wallet or fumble around in my wallet for my insurance card. I didn’t do any of the things I was so used to doing. Instead, I sat down in a chair pressed tightly against the back wall, pressed in even more with chairs on both sides of it and a coffee table to the front. I, who always chose to sit next to the office doors for quick access and breathing space, was not just physically stuck, I was mentally stuck too.</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes flickered as I became aware of the panic rising through me. I don’t know how eyes flicker. I don’t know if that’s what even happened. As far as I’m concerned, something changed in the way she was looking at me. It became mocking. It became sinister. </p>

<p>I tried to move. Nothing would, not even my eyes. Praying to a God I didn’t believe in, I wanted to move something, anything. My insides moved instead, more than they should’ve been. My heartbeat, my breathing, all of it was rushed. Even the contents, or lack of, in my stomach were trying to go somewhere, anywhere but here, but otherwise, I was a statue. As if this woman, still eyeing me, was Medusa and I, her victim. </p>

<p>My mind slowly began to shut itself down, no thoughts processed properly other than an internal verbalization of fear and nerves.</p>

<p>End this. End this. Go away. Leave me alone. Don’t look at me. Leave! Don’t look! Stop, please, stop. I don’t want this. I want to sleep. I want to disappear. I can’t breathe. I don’t like this. Please st—</p>

<p>Then the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>From behind the office doors, God decided to create mankind. Life began to make its appearance in the barren land. Silence was replaced with the trivial sounds of a clinic in the afternoon. Without paying too much attention, I could hear someone heating up their lunch. Another person, further in the distance, was ushering a medicinal cart from the storage room to the lab. I could even tell that the printer had clocked in, working with sheer determination to spit out contracts, lab results, and receipts.</p>

<p>Just as the warmth of bodies behind those closed doors began to shift, the warmth in my own did as well. My eyelids slacked, closed, rested, and then opened. </p>

<p>And then there was her face, merely an inch away from mine, her coarse hair brushing against my cheeks. She was smiling, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Her eyes were the same, unpleasant and menacing, but they were no longer stranded boats in a sea of white. They were solid, piercing through me. I knew, with those eyes, that she saw everything. All of my secrets, all of my fears, all of my regrets, she saw it all and made sure I knew.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth. With difficulty, I attempted to say something. I didn’t know what I wanted to say. I don’t think I had anything to say. In that moment, I just wanted to make sure I was still capable of sound, even if it meant screaming.</p>

<p>The sound that came out wasn’t a scream. In fact, it wasn’t even my voice.</p>

<p>It was Marcella’s. </p>

<p>Leaving the statue of me behind, I faced forward and looked up. Marcella was smiling. She was a bubbly lady, I envied the energy that seemed to trickle out from her pores. She asked why I didn’t come to greet her, and, more importantly, why I didn’t sign in. I couldn’t answer. She didn’t need me to anyway, announcing, with an unnecessarily proud smile, that said she did it for me. I didn’t thank her, still feeling shaken, and I could tell she was concerned, but there was also a knowing look in her eyes, a look that acknowledged that it was something that couldn’t be helped. She patted my shoulder and told me to follow along. </p>

<p>The doctor was ready to see me. </p>

<p>My body moved. Keeping myself close to Marcella, I took advantage of my regained physical freedom. Reluctantly, I glanced back. The 20 seats that I had declared empty were anything but. Only 5 or so were free for the next batch of patients that might come in. My newfound confusion wasn’t enough to replace the fear I had been drowning in, and I think it showed. Marcella nudged me as we passed through the halls, her smile still plastered across her face. I couldn’t tell if it was genuine. </p>

<p>Without thinking, still following her obediently, I asked under my breath,</p>

<p>“My medication… What are the side-effects?”</p>

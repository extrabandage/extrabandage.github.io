<p>I didn’t notice her until an impulse, one people get quite often around strangers, prompted me to turn my head in her direction. She sits to the left of me with no prescence. I had never seen her before, but the image of her stiff posture and her flat expression made sure I don't have a chance to forget. I question her silently. There are twenty other free seats yet she choses the chair right next to me? Odd. I fidget in my seat, trying to seek a comfort I will never find. Come to think of it, when did she come into clinic? I'm fairly sure I was the only person in the room for the past 30 minutes. It had been completely silent. It still is. </p>
  
<p>Uneasily, I look forward again. <i>Mind your own business.</i> I try to redirect my thoughts elsewhere. What was I thinking about before? I try to think up the answer, but my mind goes blank. All I know for sure is that my nerves are going full-throttle and that in this space with just the two of us, the air is just a little bit too thin.</p>

<p>The room has a sterile smell—a smell only a hospital or clinic can have. There's also a hint of something else. Burnt eggs? No, that doesn't make sense. I'm just being weird right now. Even the clock above the office door ticks and tocks like it's taunting me. <i>Stop that.</i></p>

<p>Coming here doesn't make me nervous anymore, but this feeling... it's irritatingly familiar. My heart races and I can feel sweat persist on the soft pads of my fingers and the rounded hills of my palms. My throat feels dry too, and suddenly the image of a flourescent orange bottle flashes before me. I ake a deep breath. <i>Calm down.</i> After a short period of quiet, internal debate, I direct my attention to the woman once more as subtly as I can. My eyes do most of the work. I barely move my neck. I glance over only to notice that she had beat me to it.</p>

<p>I don’t know what freaked me out more. The fact that she was watching me or just the general eeriness of her appearance. Her pupils, limited to a small crescent as she observed me through the sides of her eyes, were intensely dark. I had heard of people with purely black eyes, but the thought of it had never creeped me out until right at this moment. My eyes were fixated on her, but I couldn’t make eye contact, letting my focus fall onto her nose or the center of her forehead. It felt as if I wasn’t allowed to look her in the eye. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, mumbling softly to myself that I must be imagining things. Slowly, I peered past my hesitant lids, only to find her still staring at me with a calmness that lodged itself in my throat and mounted itself in place with sharp nails. She was still sitting the way she had when I first noticed her: back straight, neck elongated, hands pressed tight against her knees. Now her eyes strained to keep me within her sight, freezing me in place. Wasn’t it painful? Keeping her eyes focused on me like that? Weren’t her eyes hurting? I could feel a nagging sensation crawl through my body telling me to look away, not so much for her sake but for mine.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t. I was stuck. There are stories of people who get a certain way when they sleep. As if they’re in the middle of a pleasant, or not-so pleasant, dream and all of a sudden they can’t move. Stuck. They’re aware that they’re dreaming and they’re aware that they are somehow awake. It’s the limbo between dreams and reality. Something pins them down, a weight equally distributed throughout their body, eager to seize the unconquered land. The weight swallows them and the victim stays like that for hours until the nameless, unknown thing gets bored and decides to move on. Just like that. </p>

<p>I wasn’t dreaming, though. Of that much I was sure. I made an appointment the day before, prompted by the thin veil of haze that drifted against my thoughts whenever I tried to remember something, even if it had just occurred a moment ago. This morning, I took my medicine and, just now realizing, I also forgot to eat the meal to go with it. On the way, I tripped a little over the first step of the staircase trying to get into the clinic, which I brushed off quite well if I say so myself. Then, heading to the reception window, I signed my name and—No. I didn’t. I didn’t sign in. I didn’t walk up to the window as I normally would have, as I had done many times before. I didn’t greet Marcella who had been working at the clinic longer than I had been alive. I didn’t announce my arrival with a stupid look on my face as if to say “Haha, it’s me again.” I didn’t fumble around in my backpack for my wallet or fumble around in my wallet for my insurance card. I didn’t do any of the things I was so used to doing. Instead, I sat down in a chair pressed tightly against the back wall, pressed in even more with chairs on both sides of it and a coffee table to the front. I, who always chose to sit next to the office doors for quick access and breathing space, was not just physically stuck, I was mentally stuck too.</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes flickered as I became aware of the panic rising through me. I don’t know how eyes flicker. I don’t know if that’s what even happened. As far as I’m concerned, something changed in the way she was looking at me. It became mocking. It became sinister. </p>

<p>I tried to move. Nothing would, not even my eyes. Praying to a God I didn’t believe in, I wanted to move something, anything. My insides moved instead, more than they should’ve been. My heartbeat, my breathing, all of it was rushed. Even the contents, or lack of, in my stomach were trying to go somewhere, anywhere but here, but otherwise, I was a statue. As if this woman, still eyeing me, was Medusa and I, her victim. </p>

<p>My mind slowly began to shut itself down, no thoughts processed properly other than an internal verbalization of fear and nerves.</p>

<p>End this. End this. Go away. Leave me alone. Don’t look at me. Leave! Don’t look! Stop, please, stop. I don’t want this. I want to sleep. I want to disappear. I can’t breathe. I don’t like this. Please st—</p>

<p>Then the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>From behind the office doors, God decided to create mankind. Life began to make its appearance in the barren land. Silence was replaced with the trivial sounds of a clinic in the afternoon. Without paying too much attention, I could hear someone heating up their lunch. Another person, further in the distance, was ushering a medicinal cart from the storage room to the lab. I could even tell that the printer had clocked in, working with sheer determination to spit out contracts, lab results, and receipts.</p>

<p>Just as the warmth of bodies behind those closed doors began to shift, the warmth in my own did as well. My eyelids slacked, closed, rested, and then opened. </p>

<p>And then there was her face, merely an inch away from mine, her coarse hair brushing against my cheeks. She was smiling, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Her eyes were the same, unpleasant and menacing, but they were no longer stranded boats in a sea of white. They were solid, piercing through me. I knew, with those eyes, that she saw everything. All of my secrets, all of my fears, all of my regrets, she saw it all and made sure I knew.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth. With difficulty, I attempted to say something. I didn’t know what I wanted to say. I don’t think I had anything to say. In that moment, I just wanted to make sure I was still capable of sound, even if it meant screaming.</p>

<p>The sound that came out wasn’t a scream. In fact, it wasn’t even my voice.</p>

<p>It was Marcella’s. </p>

<p>Leaving the statue of me behind, I faced forward and looked up. Marcella was smiling. She was a bubbly lady, I envied the energy that seemed to trickle out from her pores. She asked why I didn’t come to greet her, and, more importantly, why I didn’t sign in. I couldn’t answer. She didn’t need me to anyway, announcing, with an unnecessarily proud smile, that said she did it for me. I didn’t thank her, still feeling shaken, and I could tell she was concerned, but there was also a knowing look in her eyes, a look that acknowledged that it was something that couldn’t be helped. She patted my shoulder and told me to follow along. </p>

<p>The doctor was ready to see me. </p>

<p>My body moved. Keeping myself close to Marcella, I took advantage of my regained physical freedom. Reluctantly, I glanced back. The 20 seats that I had declared empty were anything but. Only 5 or so were free for the next batch of patients that might come in. My newfound confusion wasn’t enough to replace the fear I had been drowning in, and I think it showed. Marcella nudged me as we passed through the halls, her smile still plastered across her face. I couldn’t tell if it was genuine. </p>

<p>Maybe nothing is.</p>

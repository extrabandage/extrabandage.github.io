<p>this city eats people. the proof can be seen on the street sides where beds are made of concrete curbs and rotting cardboard. here, the best way to satiate one’s hunger is to sleep. but sometimes dreams can be a little too sweet and a little too fulfilling—morning will never come for them. </p>
<p>it is a city divided in two, as most cities are. what remains of the history books says as much. humans have long had the habit of seeing segregation as a sign of progress, but in truth, there’s not much difference between those who live south of the boulevard and those north of it. everyone is guilty of something. their sins weigh more than the coins in their pockets ever could. but north of the boulevard, they have beds—actual beds with sheets that feel like innocence. and ironically enough, the people to the north rarely sleep—their stomachs are utterly filled with polluted meat and tinctured wine, and everyone knows it’s bad to sleep with a full stomach.  </p>
<p>the city knows this too.  </p>
<p>at night, when the stars are replaced with flickering fluorescence and bright neon lights, something strange happens. the streets begin to move the way a digestive system does, slightly churning to and fro. it can’t be felt, only seen, and it can only be seen from the roofs of the tall buildings north of the boulevard. at night, the city’s stomach rumbles with the sound of machinery toiling and pumping and smoking and grinding. and like a whisper, crude, metal tendrils appear from the shadows to swallow bodies whole into the storm drains. </p>
<p>when morning comes, there will be less people asleep in the streets. here today, gone tomorrow–the city and its inhabitants will wake up to the sound of their stomachs crying, but only those in the north will have something to eat.
